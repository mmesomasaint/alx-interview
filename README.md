This repository contains code listings for ALX interview questions. The code listings are grouped into directories based on the topics they cover.

*Click on any of them to view the code listings for that topic.*

- [Pascals Triangle](pascals_triangle)
    - Contains code listings for the Pascals Triangle problem.
 
- [Lockboxes](0x01-lockboxes)
    - You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

    - Write a method `canUnlockAll(boxes)` that determines if all the `boxes` can be opened.
 
- [Minimum Operations](0x02-minimum_operations)
    - In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute `only two operations` in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the `fewest            number of operations` needed to result in exactly `n H` characters in the file.

    - Prototype: `def minOperations(n)`
    - Returns an `integer`
    - If n is impossible to achieve, return `0`
